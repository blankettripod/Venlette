File for information to consider when writing code

all functions should be marked "const" and "noexcept" where available
engine code that client only (e.g. Application::update is client only) should NOT be marked "const" nor "noexcept"
but parent functions must catch any exceptions to maintain top level "noexcept"

memory allocations should be placed in try catch blocks

all code should log whenever any one of the following requirements:
    1. an exception is thrown
    2. mission critical functionality failed
    3. external control is passed (e.g. a Vulkan draw call would count but mapping a buffer would not unless it failed)


TODO: update code to use dx style signatures e.g. VEN_RESULT myFunction(const WindowInfo* info, Output** ppOutput)

TODO: put all allocations into a try catch block
